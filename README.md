# Realtime Messenger

## Overview

This is a webapp I created myself to learn more about websockets and how to connect two different clients to each other. It is a basic text messaging app where you can send messages.

## Features

- **Simplistic Frontend Design**: Easy to use with a simple chatlog and the ability to send messages
- **Realtime Messaging**: Utilizes websockets to send and receive messages in realtime

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
1. React
2. CSS
3. HTML
4. JavaScript
5. Tailwind

### Backend
1. Javascript
2. WS

## Requirements

You can run the setup.sh script to get the webapp quickly running. Note that the backend runs on port 8080 and the two frontend instances run on port 3000 and 3001 respectively.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Extra Notes

Note this runs the instances in the background so you will have to kill them yourselves manually to free the ports.
